	* GPL: Use GPL v3 for all source code.

2010-12-30  Tim Jenness  <tjenness@cpan.org>

	---- CPAN Version 3.02 ----

	* Build.PL: Use Module::Build

2010-09-08 Tim Jenness <tjenness@cpan.org>

	* lib/Astro/FITS/Header/NDF.pm: Make error reporting more useful.

2009-03-16  Tim Jenness  <tjenness@cpan.org>

	---- CPAN Version 3.01 -----

2009-03-16 Craig DeForest <deforest@boulder.swri.edu>

	* Header.pm (tied interface): make sure that HISTORY cards are
	treated as comments by default (formerly only COMMENT cards
	were treated as comments; therefore the {HISTORY} field was
	comming up blank, requiring {HISTORY_COMMENT} instead.)

2008-08-01  Tim Jenness  <tjenness@cpan.org>

	* lib/Astro/FITS/Header.pm (tie): Fix tie for subheaders if the last item in the FITS
	header is a comment.

2008-07-01  Tim Jenness  <tjenness@cpan.org>

	* lib/Astro/FITS/Header.pm (tie): Fix warnings when storing UNDEF value through tie.

2008-04-07  Brad Cavanagh <b.cavanagh@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* lib/Astro/FITS/Header/Item.pm (copy): Add a copy constructor. This is more reliable
	than stringifying the header item and then using it in a Item constructor.

2008-02-28  Tim Jenness  <tjenness@cpan.org>

	* lib/Astro/FITS/Header/NDF.pm (configure): Attempt to work around the fact that
	NDF can not read a file that includes a directory path with whitespace.

2008-01-29  Tim Jenness  <tjenness@cpan.org>

	* lib/Astro/FITS/Header/NDF.pm (configure): It is no longer an
	error If the NDF is perfectly valid but there is no FITS
	extension,

2008-01-24  Tim Jenness <tjenness@cpan.org>

	* lib/Astro/FITS/Header/Item.pm (configure): Guess type if no type provided.

2007-11-14  Tim Jenness  <tjenness@cpan.org>

	* lib/Astro/FITS/Header/AST.pm (configure): Allow the Encoding to be specified.

2007-10-10  Brad Cavanagh <b.cavanagh@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* lib/Astro/FITS/Header.pm (removebyname): Fix card removal when more than
	one card matches the given regular expression.

2007-07-30  Brad Cavanagh <b.cavanagh@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* lib/Astro/FITS/Header.pm: Modifications to append() method: Do
	not append SIMPLE card if requested to do so. Rebuild lookup table
	after appending all cards, not after each card. If asked to append
	a new header, do so before the END card, not after it, if the END
	card exists. Fix bug when appending a card that exists in the
	header but has an undefined value.

2007-07-11  Brad Cavanagh <b.cavanagh@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* lib/Astro/FITS/Header.pm: Add append() method to add new or
	overwrite existing headers.

2007-02-27  Tim Jenness  <tjenness@cpan.org>

	* lib/Astro/FITS/Header.pm: Hash constructor converts values with
	newlines into multiple items. BLANK lines are skipped when merging.

	* lib/Astro/FITS/Header/Item.pm: Add BLANK item support and fix
	some warnings associated with undef comments.

2007-02-22  Tim Jenness  <tjenness@cpan.org>

	* lib/Astro/FITS/Header.pm (configure): Add support for Hash constructor.

2006-08-18  Tim Jenness  <tjenness@cpan.org>

        ---- CPAN Version 3.000 ----

        * All: Update CVS version extraction to use 3 decimal places and to zero-pad.
	Also update reference versions to 3.0 so that CPAN will see that modules have
	changed.

	* CFITSIO/CFITSIO.pm: Apply patch from Diab Jerius (RT #4816) to
	test when $args{File} has not been specified.

2006-02-08  Brad Cavanagh <b.cavanagh@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* GSD/GSD.pm: Astro::FITS::Header::Item objects created from GSD
	files now have proper FITS types.

2005-04-10  Tim Jenness  <tjenness@cpan.org>

	* Item/Item.pm (parse_card): Make sure the card is cleaned up
	before parsing it (pad to 80 characters and remove newlines). This
	fixes some warnings with truncated cards.

	* t/*.t: Upgrade all tests to Test::More

	* Header.pm (itembytype): Add new method that will select items of
	a specific type.

	* Header.pm (merge_primary): Refactor using the new equals()
	method. Now correctly returns identical items with merge_unique
	flag.

2005-04-08  Tim Jenness  <timj@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* Item/Item.pm (equals): Add equals() method to allow comparison
	of two Items

	* Header.pm (merge_primary): Add facility for merging two FITS
	headers into a single header with the shared keys, plus a set of
	unique headers.

2005-04-07  Tim Jenness  <tjenness@cpan.org>

	* Header.pm (splice): Fix splice(offset,length,list). It's never
	worked. Fix corresponding (broken) test in t/parse.t

	* t/subhdr.t: Extend tests to support both forms of subheader.

	* Header.pm (TIEARRAY): Add support for tied subheaders using a
	SUBHEADERS keyword.

	* Header.pm (subhdrs): Check class of arguments before storing them.


2005-03-07  Tim Jenness  <tjenness@cpan.org>

	* NDF/NDF.pm (writehdr): Tidy up error handling. Document that
	writehdr croaks rather than returning bad status.

2004-10-21  Tim Jenness  <tjenness@cpan.org>

	* Item/Item.pm (type): Make sure that type is upper cased. Also
	make sure that we warn about unrecognized types on stringification.

	* t/parse.t: Make sure that the cache is cleared before we test
	card creation

2004-08-31  Brad Cavanagh  <b.cavanagh@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* NDF/NDF.pm (Repository): use err_load to prevent errors
	from being output to STDOUT.

2004-03-07  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk> (Version 2.9.2)

        * Documentation updated.

2004-03-06  Brad Cavanagh <b.cavanagh@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* Header.pm: Fix tied interface so blank cards (with and without
	equals sign in column 10) come out as proper undef items or named
	comments, respectively.

	* t/tied.t: Test for above.

2004-02-29  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

	* Item/Item.pm: Fixed bug in comment parsing.

2004-02-23  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

	* Header.pm: Added get_wcs() method to allow you direct access to
	the WCS information in the header using the Starlink::AST module
	and library.

	* AST/AST.pm: Added constructor method which takes a Starlink::AST
	FrameSet as a parameter.

	* Moved test suite for Astro::FITS::Header::Item to main
	directory, and deleted separate MANIFEST for this module. Pretty
	much tied to the main Astro::FITS::Header infrastructure now,
	unlikely to be distributed separately anymore.

2003-11-12  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk> (Version 2.8.1)

	* Documentation updated and released.

2003-10-22  Brad Cavanagh  <b.cavanagh@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* t/subhdr.t: Must test with stringify enabled, so compare
	references using numify.

	* Header.pm (STORE): Do not want to stringify prematurely if we
	are accepting a blessed data structure.

2003-10-21  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk> (Version 2.8.0)

	* Applied patches supplied by Jim Lewis <jrl@ast.cam.ac.uk> which
	add support for MEF files. Modified documentation and shipped as
	version 2.8.0

2003-07-02  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk> (Version 2.7.1)

	* Applied patches, updated documentation and shipped as 2.7.1

2003-07-02  Craig DeForest  <djerius@cfa.harvard.edu>

	* Patched to correct the column locations in the COMMENT and
	HEADER cards, and removed explicit stripping of leading blanks
	from COMMENT and HEADER card values upon input.

	* Fixed test errors and added more explicit tests on the parsing.

2003-07-02  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk> (Version 2.7)

	* Applied patches, updated documentation and shipped as 2.7

2003-06-27  Craig DeForest  <djerius@cfa.harvard.edu>

	* Header.pm: Added slash-based comment parsing to the tied interface

	* t/tied.t: Added test cases.

2003-06-23  Diab Jerius  <djerius@cfa.harvard.edu>

	* Item/Item.pm (configure): automatically sets type to COMMENT
	  when keyword is COMMENT, HISTORY, or is blank. (_stringify): comment
          keyword values/comments are in columns 9-80, unlike other cards which
          are in columns 11-80.

2003-05-27  Diab Jerius  <djerius@cfa.harvard.edu>

	* t/parse.t: added test for index() regexep functionality.

	* Header.pm: index() now handles regexps as well as exact matches.
          itembyname(), value(), comment(), replacebyname(), and removebyname()
          now call index() instead of doing the search themselves, so they
          inherit the new behavior.

2003-04-28  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk> (Version 2.6.2)

	* Applied patch by Diab, shipped as 2.6.2

2003-03-28  Diab Jerius  <djerius@cfa.harvard.edu>

	* t/subhdr.t: code cleanup to avoid undefined warning

2003-03-26  Diab Jerius  <djerius@cfa.harvard.edu>

	* CFITSIO/CFITSIO.pm (writehdr):
	   if there was no END card in the existing header the initial
	   card was not written.  also, additional streamlining of code.

	* CFITSIO/CFITSIO.pm (configure):
	   the code assumed that there was an END card in the existing
	   header read by CFITSIO, which is not always the case.  Now
	   explictily adds one.

2003-03-13  Malcolm J. Currie <mjc@star.rl.ac.uk>

	* Item/Item.pm: Allow for a HIERARCH hierarchical header following
	a blank keyword.

2003-03-12 Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk> (Version 2.6.1)

	* t/hierarch.t: Added more test cases.

2003-03-12 Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk> (Version 2.6)

	* Minor documentation tweaks and released as Version 2.6

2003-03-12 Craig DeForest <deforest@boulder.swri.edu>

	* Header.pm
	   - FETCH: END card always returns ' ' if present, undef if not.
	   - STORE: END & SIMPLE cards are always put in the right place.
	   - STORE: Cleaned out some extra cruft in the card assignment
	            block
	   - new:   SIMPLE & END cards are assigned automagically
	   - Documentation: several improvements.

	* Item.pm
	   - 'F' evaluates false if assigned to a card of type LOGICAL
	     (already evaluated false if assigned to a card of unknown type).
	   - END cards no longer emit warnings with 'use strict'.

2003-03-11  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk> (Version 2.5.1)

	* Minor documentation tweaks, badged as version 2.5

	* t/hierarch.t: Added test harness for ESO HIERARCH header keywords

2003-03-10  Tim Jenness  <tjenness@cpan.org>

	* Header.pm: Add tiereturnshash, and configure it from TIEHASH

	* Header.pm (FETCH): Respect the new tiereturnshash method. If
	  true, will return multi-valued items as a reference to an array
	  rather than as a joined string (tied interface does not respect
	  calling context).

	* Header.pm (FETCH/STORE): Tied interface can now retrieve or set
	  the comment string associated with an item by adding '_COMMENT' to
	  the keyword.

2002-01-19  Malcolm J. Currie <mjc@star.rl.ac.uk>

	* Item/Item.pm: Added support for HIERARCH hierarchical keywords.

2002-12-05  Tim Jenness  <tjenness@cpan.org>

	  Astro::FITS::Header objects, using type HEADER

	* Header.pm (STORE): Allow an Astro::FITS::Header object to be
	  stored through the tied interface.

2002-12-03  Tim Jenness  <tjenness@cpan.org>

	* Header.pm (insert{): Fix problem with tied hash when
	  doing %$tieref = %new

2002-12-02  Tim Jenness  <tjenness@cpan.org>

	* NDF/NDF.pm (configure): Fix problem with SCUBA raw data. The
	  files are NDFs but are not declared as such in the type field

2002-11-27  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk> (Version 2.4)

	* Added patch provided by Diab Jerius <djerius@cfa.harvard.edu>
	which allows you to open files in ReadOnly mode. Additionally it
	moves the module over to using the new Astro::FITS::CFITSIO rather
	than the older CFITSIO module.

	* Minor documentation changes to reflect new versions of the
	Astro::FITS::CFITSIO library now needed by the module.

	* t/parse.t: Use two argument form of ok()

2002-06-10  Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

	* Minor documentation changes, integrated patches into the main
	CVS tree, released as v2.1. The major change from v1.x is a much
	improved tied interface, see the POD for details.

2002-05-14   Craig DeForest <deforest@boulder.swri.edu>

	* Header.pm: Fix to typecasting of string in tied interface

2002-05-09   Craig DeForest <deforest@boulder.swri.edu>

	* Header.pm: Added multiline support to the tied interface, using
	multiline string return -- which should preserve 0th-element
	functionality in arithmetic expressions, as expected by legacy
	code.

	* t/tied.t: added multline tests.

2002-03-29   Alasdair Allan <aa@astro.ex.ac.uk>

	* Header.pm: Added freeze() function
